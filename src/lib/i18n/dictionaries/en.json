AI assistants like ChatGPT can't recommend you based on your Facebook page. And many clients expect a 'real' business to have its own website — a Facebook-only presence can look unprofessional." },

Just email us what you want changed, and we'll do it within 24 hours. No technical skills required on your end." },
        { "question": "What if I want to cancel?", "answer": "You can cancel the monthly plan anytime — no questions asked. If you cancel, you keep ownership of your domain.
